Okay wonderful! We have successfully configured osTicket from scratch. Now we will do some system administration and work on some post installation setup.
first we will configure new roles within the help desk. In order to do so go to Admin panel-> Agents-> Roles. We will create a "Administrator" role. 
Click on "Add new role" then enter the name of the new role. You can also modify any specific roles permissions. In this case since we are creating an Administrator they will be given all permissions. Keep in mind roles are used to determine an agents permissions so not all agents will have unlimited access. If you followed the steps correctly your screen should look like something like this. As you can see we have successfully created the "Administrator" role.

Select the "Departments" button in the agents tab. Here we will be able to create a new department. Each Agent is assigned to a specific department depending on their assigned role within the helpdesk. In this case we will be creating the "System Administrators" department. Other specific settings such as SLAs, managers and other email settings can be set up in the departments tab.

<p>
After configuring a new department we will set up a new team. Teams allow you to pull agents from different departments you can have a team that has top technicians from specific departments. For example you can create a help topic that correlates with a product you produce, and assign it to a team of agents that specialize in that particular product. To set up a team go to Agents->Teams. A Level I support team has been created by default, in this example we will create a Level II Support Team.
